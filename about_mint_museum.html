                <h2>History and growth of the Mint Museum</h2>
                <p id="about-mint-museum-text">The Mint Museum, founded in 1936, holds the distinction of being North Carolina's very first art museum, marking a pivotal moment in the state’s cultural and artistic development. Originally established in the historic Charlotte Mint building—once a U.S. branch mint that produced gold coins—the institution began as a modest effort to preserve local art and regional heritage. Over time, it grew steadily in scope, ambition, and national recognition. For nearly a century, the Mint Museum has continued to thrive as one of North Carolina’s most significant cultural landmarks, evolving alongside the city of Charlotte itself. Today, the museum encompasses multiple locations and houses an extraordinary and ever-growing collection of more than 35,000 works of art. These include paintings, sculptures, decorative arts, contemporary works, and a wide variety of ancient artifacts that span centuries and civilizations. Together, these collections offer visitors a comprehensive journey through global art history, from ancient cultures to modern and contemporary artistic expression.</p>

                <h2>Mission, Collections, and Global Perspective</h2>
                <p id="about-mint-museum-text">The Mint Museum’s mission extends far beyond the simple exhibition of artwork. It is deeply committed to collecting, preserving, researching, and sharing artistic and cultural achievements from around the world. Curators, conservators, and scholars work collaboratively to ensure that each piece is carefully maintained and thoughtfully interpreted for public audiences. Through scholarly research and innovative exhibitions, the museum provides meaningful context that helps visitors understand not only what they are seeing, but why it matters. The museum seeks to inspire curiosity and lifelong learning, encourage creativity, and promote a deeper appreciation for the diversity of international art and design. By showcasing works from different cultures, time periods, and artistic movements, the Mint Museum fosters dialogue, broadens perspectives, and helps connect global histories with contemporary life.</p>

                <h2>Honoring Indigenous Peoples and African American Contributions</h2>
                <p id="about-mint-museum-text">In addition to its artistic mission, the Mint Museum acknowledges and honors the deep and complex history of the land it occupies. The institution recognizes the Catawba, Cheraw, Sugaree, Waxhaw, and other Indigenous peoples who originally gathered, lived, and thrived in this region long before European settlement. This acknowledgment reflects the museum’s broader commitment to historical truth and cultural respect. Furthermore, the Mint Museum pays tribute to the unseen and often unrecognized labor of people of African ancestry who contributed to the creation, maintenance, and development of the Mint Museum at Randolph throughout its history. By recognizing these contributions, the museum confronts difficult aspects of the past and works toward a more inclusive and honest understanding of history, ensuring that the stories of marginalized communities are not overlooked.</p>
