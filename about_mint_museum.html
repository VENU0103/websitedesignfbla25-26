        <p>The Mint Museum, founded in 1936, holds the distinction of being North Carolina's very first art museum. For nearly a century, it has continued to thrive as one of the state's most significant cultural landmarks. Today, the museum houses an extraordinary collection of more than 35,000 works of art, including paintings, sculptures, and a wide variety of ancient artifacts.</p>

        <p>The Mint Museum's mission goes far beyond simple exhibition—it is devoted to collecting, preserving, researching, and sharing artistic and cultural achievements from around the world. Its goal is to inspire curiosity, foster creativity, and celebrate the diversity of international art and design.</p>

        <p>The museum also acknowledges and honors the deep history of the land it occupies. It recognizes the Catawba, Cheraw, Sugaree, Waxhaw, and other Indigenous peoples who originally gathered in this region. In addition, the Mint Museum pays tribute to the unseen and often unrecognized labor of people of African ancestry who contributed to the creation and development of the Mint Museum at Randolph throughout its history.</p>
